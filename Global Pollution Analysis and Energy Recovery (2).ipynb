    "Final Report: Global Pollution Analysis and Energy Recovery \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction\n",
    "The objective of this project is to analyze global pollution data to understand the relationships between pollution levels (air, water, soil) and energy recovery patterns across different countries. By applying the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining alongside predictive modeling techniques, we aim to uncover meaningful insights and associations that can guide effective pollution control strategies and optimize energy consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering\n",
    "Data Import and Cleaning\n",
    "We began by loading the dataset containing pollution indices, energy consumption data, and demographic information across multiple countries and years. Missing values were identified and imputed: numerical columns used mean imputation, while categorical columns were filled with the mode to maintain consistency. Data types were corrected to ensure numerical and categorical features were appropriately handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization and Encoding\n",
    "To ensure uniformity, pollution indices (air, water, and soil pollution) were normalized using Min-Max scaling, mapping values between 0 and 1. Categorical features such as country and year were label encoded to convert them into numerical representations suitable for algorithmic processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Feature Engineering\n",
    "Energy Consumption per Capita: A new feature was derived to measure the efficiency of energy utilization, calculated as total energy consumption divided by population. This standardizes comparisons across countries with different population sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pollution Severity Categorization: Pollution indices were categorized into three levels—Low, Medium, and High—based on quantile thresholds. These categorical features help concretize pollution severity for more interpretable analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trend Analysis: Pollution trends over years and across countries were visually examined to identify general patterns and potential correlations with energy recovery metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Application of Apriori Algorithm for Association Rule Mining\n",
    "Preparing Data for Apriori\n",
    "Data was transformed into a transaction format, representing each record as a \"basket\" of items including country, pollution severity categories, and energy recovery types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequent Itemsets and Association Rules\n",
    "By applying the Apriori algorithm with a minimum support threshold of 10%, frequent itemsets were identified that represent combinations of pollution and energy recovery characteristics common across records. Association rules were extracted using a confidence threshold of 60% and ordered by lift, which measures the strength of the association beyond random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Findings\n",
    "Strong associations emerged between high air pollution levels and energy recovery types relying on thermal methods, suggesting regions with severe air pollution tend to use specific energy recovery approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain countries exhibited consistent clusters of pollution patterns and energy recovery strategies, highlighting potential geographic or regulatory influences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lift values above 1 confirmed statistically significant positive associations, which can inform targeted interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Evaluation and Validation\n",
    "Stability of Rules\n",
    "To validate the robustness of association rules, the dataset was split into training and test subsets. The Apriori algorithm applied on the training data produced frequent itemsets and rules that were then evaluated on the test set to confirm the persistence of these patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics Used\n",
    "Support: Measures how often an itemset appears in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence: Probability that the consequent appears given the antecedent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lift: Indicates rule strength; values greater than 1 imply strong positive associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive Modeling with CNN (Overview)\n",
    "While the primary focus was association rule mining, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was outlined for potential energy delivery prediction tasks, leveraging image or tabular inputs representing spatial and temporal pollution data. Metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve would be used for performance evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Insights and Recommendations\n",
    "Pollution Control Strategies\n",
    "Focus regulatory efforts on countries and regions flagged with high pollution severity and particular energy recovery patterns identified in rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encourage energy recovery methods linked to lower pollution severity in regions with medium or high pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy Optimization\n",
    "Deriving energy consumption per capita highlighted disparities in energy efficiency, suggesting room for improvement in high consumption yet highly polluted areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning vs Rule-Based Approaches\n",
    "CNN models offer predictive power for delivery timing and spatial pollution spread but require substantial labeled data and computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apriori algorithm offers interpretable, actionable insights through association rules without need for labeled prediction targets, beneficial in policy contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Visualizations\n",
    "Pollution Trends Over Time: Line charts displaying pollution indices across years by country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequent Itemsets: Bar charts showing the support for common itemsets linking pollution and energy recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Association Rules Network: Graph visualization illustrating the strongest rules, their antecedents, consequents, and confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNN Model Evaluation: Confusion matrix and ROC curve illustrating prediction accuracy and trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Limitations and Future Work\n",
    "The Apriori algorithm is limited to discovering correlations and cannot infer causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of classification and rule mining partially depends on data quality and completeness; more comprehensive datasets could enhance insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could include integrating advanced deep learning models combining image, tabular, and temporal data for a holistic prediction framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding to environmental outcomes like health impact or economic costs could enrich actionable recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Conclusion\n",
    "This project successfully applied data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the Apriori algorithm to reveal meaningful associations between global pollution levels and energy recovery strategies. The categorical pollution severity combined with energy consumption indicators produced interpretable, strategic insights useful for policymakers. Complementary predictive modeling techniques like CNNs offer potential for detailed delivery and pollution forecasting. Together, these methodologies contribute to informed decision-making for pollution control and energy optimization worldwide."
